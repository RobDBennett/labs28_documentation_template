## Description (Same for all repos)
Include a paragraph describing the project. Some things you should write about in your description are:
- A breif description of the Stakeholder Company and their goals overall.  
- A breif description of the company's goals with this project.  
- What is the problem(s) your team is trying to solve/answer.
- The final(or planned) solution to the problem(s)

Add the final product video for either web or ds (depending on what the repo is for) here.

## Contributors (Same for all repos)
Include a list of all the contributors and links to their GitHubs and LinkedIn Profiles.

Here is an example of how you could do it:
- Fork and clone to get the code for the table below
- Paste it twice to add more teammates and make sure to include a blank line in between the two
- Be sure to update ALL github and linkedin links with your team's info or it will link to me and my friends
- You can get each person's picture by clicking on their GitHub profile picture and copying the url in the browser
- The people in the photos below are some of my favorite people from lambda school... You should follow them
